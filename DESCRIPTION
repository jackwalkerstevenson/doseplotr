Description: A system for analyzing and visualizing the dose-dependent effects
    of one or more treatments on one or more targets. You can import data for
    multiple combinations of treatments and targets, and 'doseplotr' can
    generate summary statistics (e.g. EC50) and plots for each combination of
    treatment and target. It can also generate more complex plots, such as a
    plot overlaying the effects of one treatment on all targets tested.
