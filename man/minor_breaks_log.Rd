\title{Generate minor breaks for an axis in log units}
\usage{
minor_breaks_log(min_val, max_val)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_val}{The minimum value to plot, or log floor of same, in
log-transformed units (-8.3 and -8 will both be converted to -8).}

\item{max_val}{The maximum value to plot, or log ceiling of same, in
log-transformed units (-4.5 and -4 will both be converted to -4).}
}
\value{
A vector of minor axis breaks in log-transformed units.
}
\description{
This function generates non-logistic minor axis breaks for an axis that uses
log-transformed units, such that the data being plotted is e.g. -3 rather
than 0.001. For instance, the minor breaks between -9 and -8 logM, i.e. 1 nM
and 10 nM, represent 1,2,3... nM rather than -8.9,-8.8,-8.7... logM.

minor_breaks_log(-12, -4)
minor_breaks_log(-12.2, -3.6)
